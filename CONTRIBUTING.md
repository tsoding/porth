No contributions are accepted right now since the language is not
stablized yet and I'm actively experimenting with the
design. Contributions will be opened later when I feel that the
language is stable enough. Feel free to do whatever you want with the
source code itself according to the MIT license though.

If you have any questions about the language or want to report bugs
(NO FEATURE REQUESTS) please send them to reximkut@gmail.com or
tsodingbiz@gmail.com
